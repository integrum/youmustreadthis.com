Your brain is a machine. Knowing how it is wired and the architecture with in it is key to getting it's best performance. I wont even bother arguing with someone about using physical boards vs digital boards or have a discussion about learning/fluency until they understand the principles in this book. If you are looking for the "why" so many things in Agile work, this book will help explain them.
